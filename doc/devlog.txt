  - Wow that's an intense article. It shows how the world of CS really can be crazy.
  - Everyone just does what they can to get by and says they'll go back and fix it later.
  - I think that it's necessary to have other hobbies if you want to get into this world so you don't drive yourself crazy.
  - Our team has a few protocols/procedures that we plan to follow so we make our time together as easy and stressless as possible.
      - Communicating when we have an issue. We want to be a team that instead of cutting corners and hacking out answers, we can talk to each other and come up with a better solution.
      - Before finalizing any code, we're each going to look over each other's work to make sure that everything is understandable.
      - Finally, we plan to really stress the use of comments in our code. Comments make it easier on all of us, so we know if there are any rough patches to fix or just  a small explanation to guide us.

  SQLite operations
  - JOIN operations are used to query data from two or more tables.
  - INNER JOIN
    - Matches every row from one table with every row from another table where the join condition specified after the ON keyword is true (using foreign keys).
    - For our purposes: both the StoryTitles and StoryUpdates table have a "Title" column. The latter doesn't track the creator of a story. We can remedy that by matching rows that have the same title between the two tables, then combine them together. Then we get a single "set" that has the creator column in addition to the columns already present in the StoryUpdates table.
  - LEFT JOIN
    - Same as INNER JOIN except every single row from the "left" table is included. If no rows from the "right" table being joined to the left table matches (via the join condition), NULL is in place of the row.
    - This means that you can specifically find rows that don't match by adding a WHERE clause: WHERE (column) is NULL.
    - This should only be useful if we allow users to submit nothing to forms (e.g. not having a password, not submitting any text when creating or updating a story, etc.)
  - CROSS JOIN
    - Does not use a join condition
    - Combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table to form the result set.
    - If the first table has N rows, the second table has M rows, the final result has N x M rows.
    - Basically makes every combination possible out of the columns of the selected tables.
    - Don't see how this would be useful for our project.

  -JOIN operations
    -can be used to structure data more efficiently for different uses. ex: merging the storyTitles and storyUpdates tables to show the activity of a user: the stories they have created and the stories they edited; as opposed to merging both tables based on the title of the story and creating a list of users that have interacted with the story. The first option centers the story interaction data around the user and the second centers the users' data around the stories they interact with.
  -CROSS JOIN
    -can be used to create a copy of a newly posted story for each user, so they can edit their own "version" of the story separate from other users. The table would increase by n rows each time a story is created, for n users in the database.

  - Wrote script that initializes the database
  - Added a base app.py file to add to

kevinL - 2019-10-22 08:29
  - Added a static help page

emoryW - 2019-10-22 21:51
  - Made a utl folder
  - Moved db_builder into utl
  - Wrote functions that add entries to database tables

kevinL - 2019-10-22 23:07
  - Put a db_ops.py file in utl that contains a fn. that checks if an account exists in the DB and a fn. that adds the account via form if so
  - Generated bare database file that has a table called "accounts" with two columns: "username" and "password".
  - Handle secret keys
  - Home, login, signup, and register routes (the latter does the aforementioned  account checking following the form in the signup route)
  - Base template for login and signup

kevinL - 2019-10-24 08:30
  - Got the login mechanism working - linked to database

emoryW - 2019-10-24 8:41
  - Worked on db operations
  - Added the other two tables

kevinL - 2019-10-24 16:30
  - Created instructions for running the project

rayL - 2019-10-24 19:00
  - changed pass parameter in addAccount to password (in db_ops.py)
  - added a newstory route to the app.py
  - added a welcome page template
  - added a new story page template (checks for user login)
    - user not allowed to create a new story if they are not logged in, but for the purposes of development, comment out conditional that checks for user in session in order to see the new story template w/o restrictions

kevinL - 2019-10-24 22:22
  - Flash messages when appropriate and use redirect rather than re-rendering pages (thx for the indirect suggestion Ray)
  - Simplified a lot of the logic due to discovering the fact that HTML input fields let you control whether you are required to have some text in it, max/min characters, etc.
  - Establish session/Logout function
  - POST everything (guys lmk if I should allow GET so that query strings are shown)
  - /create route links to Ray's new story template
  - Use jinja2 extend to minimize repetitiveness in HTML files
  - After creating a story, it now gets added to the database. You are not allowed to create two stories of the same title.

emoryW - 2019-10-25 8:30
  - Checked over recent work to look for errors
  - Made sure that database was updating correctly
  - Everything is looking good
  - Added a 'Back to Login' button

kevinL - 2019-10-25 08:30
  - Laid the groundwork for accessing stories contributed to on the landing page

kevinL - 2019-10-25 10:10
  - Using popups for the help page so you don't get redirected to the login page if you are logged in

kevinL - 2019-10-25 18:45
  - The latest update to stories are now shown on the /stories route

kevinL - 2019-10-25 22:54
  - Stories a user has contributed to will now show on their homepage.

kevinL - 2019-10-26 11:24
  - Logic handling whether or not you can edit a story
  - Show latest update on individual story page
  - Utilize session data to keep text written for a story if you fail to create one

kevinL - 2019-10-26 11:55
  - Design doc v2
    - Updated site map to be more accurate to the actual site
    - Use more correct terminology
    - Clarify that when loading up the site for the first time, you should be on the login page.
    - Include all elements of the top menu of the site
    - Clarify that stories that a user has contributed to will be shown IN FULL, not just the latest update.
    - Get rid of stuff like NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY, didn't come into play for this project
    - Change the site flat out barring you from viewing a story you've contributed to on the stories page - you can view it, you just can't add to it as the text area is grayed out.

emoryW - 2019-10-26
  - Took out back button on help page because it creates new tab
  - Made another testing account to check on stories again
  - Everything looks great super happy with our progress!

rayL - 2019-10-26 15:03
  -fixed syntax within app.py
  -made login conditionals for /create /addstory /addstoryupdate /stories and /stories/<title> to make it less exploitable
  -users cannot log out if they are not in session
  
rayL - 2019-10-26 15:20
  -added more concise flash messages when logged out user is trying to access different routes

rayL = 2019-10-26 18:22
  -added a search feature using levenshtein distance to ease the UX given a lot of stories
